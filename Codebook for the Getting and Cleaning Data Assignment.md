Codebook for the Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment
This codebook is for the averages1.txt file data.      There are 180 rows and 68 columns.  The text file contains the column headers with the data.

Activity:
•	The activity performed.    There are 6 activities in total:
•	Laying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Walking_Downstairs, Walking_Upstairs

Participant:
•	This is the subject.   It is a number between 1 and 30.

The following 66 variables contain the average of the variables (in the original testing and training data) that included mean() and std() in their header names  for each activity and participant.
For example, the first row might show 
Laying,  Participant 1,  66 variables showing the average for Laying and Participant 1 for a particular measurement (e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X)
